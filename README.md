# Persistent_Homology

I make the code to caculate the barcode using the Vietoris Rips Complex.

The code is almost identical to Javaplex and Gudhi's algorithms. 
However, the method of selecting the representative of homology class is different.
This representative is importantly used in topological music analysis. 
It has a great advantage of being written and shared in Python language.

If you want to try to run this code, open file “Tutorial_for_Calculate_barcode_RipsComplex.ipynb” and run it.

From the distance matrix, we can calculate the barcode using the Vietoris-Rips complex.
